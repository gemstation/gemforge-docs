The Gemforge configuration file - `gemforge.config.cjs` - tells how Gemforge how to understand your project layout and what actions to take.

The default [configuration file template](https://github.com/gemstation/gemforge/blob/master/templates/gemforge.config.cjs) contains all possible configuration options as well as accompanying comments explaining their purpose.

Note: ALL configuration options are mandatory, as this then makes everything explicit, reducing the chance of errors.
