# Generator

Generator options modify the behaviour of the code generator. 

```js
// gemforge.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  ...
  generator: {
    // proxy interface options
    proxyInterface: {
      // imports to include in the generated IDiamondProxy interface
      imports: [],
    },
  },
  ...
}
```

## Proxy interface imports

The `generator.proxyInterface.imports` array lists files which should be imported within the [generated diamond proxy interface](../commands/build.md) code.

This is only required if any of your facet methods either take a struct as input or return a struct as output.

For example, if you had the following facet file:

```solidity
// file: src/MyFacet.sol

struct GameParams {
  uint maxPlayers;
}

contract MyFacet {
  function createGame(GameParams memory params);
}
```

Then the proxy interface file generated by Gemforge would contain this method signature. However, the file wouldn't compile since the struct isn't imported by it:

```solidity
// file: src/generated/IDiamondProxy.sol

interface IDiamondProxy {
  function createGame(GameParams memory params);  // will FAIL to compile!
}
```

To fix this, you would define a file containing the struct - e.g `Structs.sol` - and then import that into your facet code:

```solidity
// file: src/Structs.sol
struct GameParams {
  uint maxPlayers;
}

// file: src/MyFacet.sol
import "Structs.sol";

contract MyFacet {
  function createGame(GameParams memory params);
}
```

Now you would modify the config as follows:

```js
// file: gemforge.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  ...
  generator: {
    // proxy interface options
    proxyInterface: {
      // imports to include in the generated IDiamondProxy interface
      imports: [
        "src/Structs.sol"
      ],
    },
  },
  ...
}
```

The `Structs.sol` file would then be imported by the generated proxy interface via the correct relative folder path, and the interface code itself would now compile:

```solidity
// file: src/generated/IDiamondProxy.sol

import "../Structs.sol";

interface IDiamondProxy {
  function createGame(GameParams memory params); // will successfully compile!
}
```
